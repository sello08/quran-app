This is my first project in Vuejs. I just tried what I can do with vuejs and in some sense I have done training with this project. It basically fetches data from a public api and reveals to the user. Some famous technologies/libraries used in this project are Axios for communicating with the api, Vuex for storing data in redux store, Ant design for using some handy built in ui elements.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
